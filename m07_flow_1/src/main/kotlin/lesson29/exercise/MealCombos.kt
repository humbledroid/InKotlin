/* ****************************************************************************

   Update your solution from Lesson 27's lesson so that it uses Flow operators
   instead of Collection or Sequence operators. The output of your solution
   should be the same as in Lesson 27.

   Note that you can use `asFlow()` to convert collection types into a flow,
   and `toList()` to convert a flow to a list.
