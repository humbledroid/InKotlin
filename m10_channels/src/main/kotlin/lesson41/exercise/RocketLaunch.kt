/* ****************************************************************************

   Update your solution from the previous exercise so that it uses channels
   instead of queues. The behavior and output should be identical.

   Your solution will likely eliminate the need for the abstract `Worker`
   class, although you'll still need the `simulateWork()` function.

   It's fine if the process doesn't terminate when you run your solution.
   We'll address that in a lesson later in this unit.
