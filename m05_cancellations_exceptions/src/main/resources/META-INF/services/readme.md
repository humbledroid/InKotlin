# ServiceLoader Example

This directory exists for Lesson 22, states 4 and 5.

To register `MyCustomHandler` and `MyCustomHandler2` classes with the Service Loader,
create a file in this directory named `kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineExceptionHandler`,
and put the following contents in that file:

```
lesson22.content.state04.MyCustomHandler
lesson22.content.state04.MyCustomHandler2
```

When you're done, be sure to either delete that file or rename it so that it doesn't
interfere with the code for other lessons in this unit!
