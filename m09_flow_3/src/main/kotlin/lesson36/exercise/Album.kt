   This lesson introduced the high-level concepts for hot flows, without yet
   showing how to write them. But, this exercise will give you a starting point
   for the rest of the exercises in this unit.

   Whenever you're feeling down, Scott Joplin, the King of Ragtime, is there to
   help put a pep in your step!

   Write a cold flow that will iterate over the following songs with the
   indicated delay, as a simulation of playing each song:

       - Maple Leaf Rag     - 1.5 seconds
       - The Entertainer    - 2.0 seconds
       - The Easy Winners   - 1.5 seconds
       - Elite Syncopations - 1.0 seconds
       - Peacherine Rag     - 1.0 seconds

   For each song in this album, print out the name of the song that's playing.
   For example: `🎹 Now playing: Maple Leaf Rag`
