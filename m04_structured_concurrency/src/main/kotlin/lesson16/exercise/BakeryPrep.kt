/* ****************************************************************************

   Update your solution for Lesson 15's exercise so that each group of tasks is
   in its own suspending function.

   suspend fun doKitchenPrep() { ... }
   suspend fun doCustomerPrep() { ... }
   suspend fun cleanUp() { ... }

   Remember:
   - All the tasks should be worked in parallel.
   - Show the message when each group of tasks is complete.
   - Show a message when the bakery is ready to open, after all tasks have
     been completed.
