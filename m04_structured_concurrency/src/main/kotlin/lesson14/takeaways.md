# Key Takeaways 🔑

1. Programming _without_ unconstrainted line jumps (i.e., `GOTO` statements) is known as **Structured Programming**.
2. Structured Programming increases the predictability of the code by ensuring that the next line of code will run _after_ the preceding function call, loop, or conditional has completed.
3. Structured Concurrency applies the concepts of Structured Programming to concurrency, ensuring that the next line of code will run _after_ all of the coroutines in the scope have completed.
