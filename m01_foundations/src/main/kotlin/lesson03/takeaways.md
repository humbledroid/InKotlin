1. We can use coroutines even without using the `kotlinx.coroutines` library.
2. The coroutine-based `sequence()` function can often be a good choice for generating sequences.
3. The standard library includes a `DeepRecursiveFunction` class that can be used for recursive operations with lots of calls.
