# Key Takeaways 🔑

1. Two tasks run **concurrently** when their individual steps - or groups of steps - are _interleaved_.
2. A **coroutine** is an _execution of code_ that can be _paused_ and _resumed_.
3. Coroutines allow us to _write_ our tasks as separate blocks of code, yet _run_ our tasks concurrently.
